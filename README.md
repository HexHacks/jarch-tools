# My shell scripts

This repository contains pretty much my home-crafted utilities made for the command 
line. I use *zsh*, that might not exist on every *nix* variant. So please, like any 
good habbit you should have already anticipated you would need; 

** Only run a script if you've read its source code **

# **TODO**
Make an executable that is so horribly dangerous you can't believe what will happen 
when ran (for president).

And inscribed on the tomb-stone, twas:
If you don't believe it being very dangerous running unknown source code, I dare you
to execute the command `make-computer-bleed.sh` in this repository.
